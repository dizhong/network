Design decisions

During the milestone, dnsserver returns a randomly selected server ip address. This has been changed to geographically closest server for optimization purposes.
Caches are downloaded during deployment because requests could come in immediately after runCDN, and caching generally seems to take a few seconds.
The cached pages are stored in a folder called cache during deployment, since our CDN might be stopped anytime and would need persistent storage of cache, in contrast to an early-stage implementation where cached pages are a dictionary within the server program.
The pages selected to be stored in cache are the most popular pages recorded in the csv file. Every replica server stores the same copy.


Effectiveness evaluation

Used wget and dig to test the servers.


Future work

The amount of work I can put in this project is limited because my fingers have been numbing and my arms hurting, because I have been having RSI problems which were made significantly worse by the amount of coding I was doing earlier this semester. If I was more able to type, I would like to try active measurement for returning the best replica server. I would also like to cache content most likely to be requested by the area the server is in, instead of having every replica server store the same thing, because I imagine for example asia and america would not be interested in the same content, potentially by leaving the cdn on for a long time and have each server store its own copy of most visited pages in csv.
